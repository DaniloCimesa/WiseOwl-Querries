Code:

--In description is written that you should create view using View Designer feature in SQL Server Management Studio.
--I personally like better to write a code to create it. But I've created it using view designer and altered it manually.

--First write Create view than alter it.
ALTER VIEW [dbo].[View_1]
AS
SELECT        dbo.tblCountry.CountryName, COUNT(dbo.tblEvent.EventId) AS Expr1
FROM            dbo.tblCountry INNER JOIN
                         dbo.tblEvent ON dbo.tblCountry.CountryId = dbo.tblEvent.CountryId
WHERE        dbo.tblEvent.EventDate >= '1990-01-01'
GROUP BY dbo.tblCountry.CountryName
HAVING        (COUNT(dbo.tblEvent.EventId) >= 5)
GO


select * from view_1
